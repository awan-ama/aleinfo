# Ale Info

An Android application made for my final project in Mobile Programming course. This application allows the user to see a list of beers from an API (https://api.sampleapis.com/beers/ale).

This application used the following Library:
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Coil
- Hilt

Upcoming features:
- Login and Register functionality using Room local database
